        <div class="concept-title">Sake (鮭) - Understand the Problem</div>
        <p class="concept-description">Like the salmon's upstream journey, it's important to trace back to the root. The foundation of our approach starts by fully understanding the problem at hand. This involves tracing back to the root cause, asking pertinent questions, and setting clear aspirations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Aji (鯵) - Gather Insights</div>
        <p class="concept-description">Aji, a type of mackerel, is delicate and reflects the freshness. Similarly, insights should be fresh and relevant. Information is power. We focus on gathering fresh insights through various channels, ensuring that we base our strategies on solid data and relevant observations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Maki (巻) - Roll Out Ideas</div>
        <p class="concept-description">Like a sushi roll, ideas should be wrapped and presented seamlessly. Ideation is central to innovation. We encourage brainstorming sessions, allowing for a plethora of ideas which are then prioritized and seamlessly integrated into our solutions.</p>

    <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Uni (海胆) - Dive Deep</div>
        <p class="concept-description">Sea urchin is a delicacy that demands attention. This step is about diving deep into complex challenges. We believe in the importance of thoroughness.

    <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Rāmen (ラーメン) - Interconnect Solutions</div>
        <p class="concept-description">Rāmen is about a blend of multiple ingredients. Similarly, solutions often require a blend of strategies. In today's interconnected world, standalone solutions often fall short. We focus on blending strategies together, ensuring an interconnected and holistic approach to problem-solving.</p>

    <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Ahi (鮪) - Test and Iterate</div>
        <p class="concept-description">Ahi, or tuna, is versatile. Solutions should also be adaptable to the ever-changing environment. Perfection is a journey. We emphasize testing our solutions in controlled environments, collecting feedback, and iterating to improve and refine our approach continually.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Ikigai (生き甲斐) - Align with Purpose</div>
        <p class="concept-description">Ikigai represents a reason for being, encompassing joy, a sense of purpose, and meaning. Solutions should resonate with the core purpose. Every solution we propose is checked against the core purpose of our client's objectives. We ensure that stakeholders are onboard and that our strategies resonate with the overarching goals.</p>
